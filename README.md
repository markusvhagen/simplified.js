# simplified.js
A javscript library which aims to simplify some javascript functions.

## How to install
It is important that you important minified.js before importing your own script. 
```
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markusvhagen/simplified.js/master/src/simplified.js"></script>
<script src="myScript.js"></script>
```
If you want, you can also download the javascript by going to _ and clicking `CTRL + S`. 

## How to use simplified.js
A wiki is planned in the future, but finishing minified.js is the main goal right now.
